This project focuses on building multi-class classification models to recommend the most suitable crop for a given field based on essential soil metrics. Using the soil_measures.csv dataset, which includes measurements for nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and pH levels, the goal is to predict the optimal crop type for maximizing yield.

Dataset Features:
N: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil

P: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil

K: Potassium content ratio in the soil

pH: Soil pH value

crop: Target variable representing the recommended crop type

Objectives:
Develop multi-class classification models to predict crop types

Evaluate model performance and feature importance

Identify the single most important soil feature for crop prediction

This work helps farmers make data-driven decisions on crop selection while minimizing testing costs and optimizing yields.
